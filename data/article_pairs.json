      "title": "Hamas says ready for indirect talks to resolve \u2018points of contention\u2019 on Gaza deal",
      "content": "Hamas announced Sunday that it was prepared to immediately begin a new round of indirect negotiations on remaining \u201cpoints of contention\u201d amid pressure from mediators to soften its stance, after the terror group submitted a response to a US ceasefire and hostage deal proposal that Washington called \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHamas said in a statement that its goal for the new talks would be to reach a deal that \u201censures relief for our people and an end to the humanitarian catastrophe, ultimately leading to a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of the occupation forces.\u201d\n\nThe terror group didn\u2019t say that it had rescinded or revised the proposal that it submitted on Saturday to US special envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nWitkoffsaidSaturday that the Hamas response \u201ctakes us backward,\u201d adding that he had wanted Hamas to accept his \u201cframework proposal\u201d as the basis for a round of \u201cproximity talks\u201d to be held in the coming days.\n\nUS President Donald Trump hadindicatedon Friday that a deal could be announced later that day or on Saturday. Witkoff\u2019s statement was the first time he had publicly revealed that his proposal had only been a starting point for another round of talks.\n\nHamas in its Sunday statement appeared to confirm its willingness to hold those talks.\n\nHamas\u2019s Saturday response to Witkoff made a series of amendments to the US envoy\u2019s proposal, including one that that would make it more difficult for Israel to resume fighting if talks on a permanent ceasefire are not completed by the end of 60-day truce outlined by the US, a source directly involved in the negotiations said.\n\nThe updated proposal submitted by Hamas also envisions the release of the 10 hostages being spread out more throughout the two-month truce, rather than in two batches on the first and seventh day, as Witkoff stipulates, according to the source.\n\nThis change was aimed at preventing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from abandoning talks on a permanent ceasefire after the 10 hostages are released or refusing to engage in the talks altogether, as he did during the previous ceasefire, which ended in March when Israel resumed intensive fighting in Gaza.\n\nThe Sunday Hamas statement also made a point of thanking Arab mediators Qatar and Egypt for their efforts to bring about a ceasefire. Hours earlier, the two countries issued a joint statement \u201cemphasizing the importance of intensifying efforts to overcome the obstacles facing the negotiations.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s office said Sunday that Israel had accepted the Witkoff proposal. However, his cabinet has yet to hold a vote on it and several far-right ministers have expressed their opposition.\n\nThe US proposal was formulated in close coordination with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, who reviewed it with Witkoff during a visit to Washington last week.\n\nThe Witkoff proposal stipulates that the parties would have to reach an agreement on the parameters of Israel\u2019s partial withdrawal from Gaza during the 60-day truce. It also provides for further negotiations during the truce on a potential settlement to end the war.\n\nAccording to\u00a0a copy of Witkoff\u2019s latest proposal, the authenticity of which was confirmed to The Times of Israel by two sources familiar with the negotiations, Hamas would release 10 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza and return the bodies of 18 deceased hostages during the 60-day ceasefire.\n\nIn return, Israel would release 125 Palestinian terror convicts serving life sentences, 1,111 Gazans detained since the start of the war on October 7, 2023, and 180 bodies of Palestinians currently held by Israel.\n\nThe IDF would also pull back from some areas where troops are currently deployed; the parameters of the pullback would be finalized \u201cduring proximity negotiations.\u201d\n\nThere are currently 58 hostages held in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF, and 20 hostages who are believed to be alive. There are grave concerns for the well-being of three others, Israeli officials have said.\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz said Sunday that \u201cregardless of any negotiations,\u201d he instructed the IDF \u201cto continue forward in Gaza\u201d and achieve all objectives.\n\nFollowing Katz\u2019s statement, the IDF announced that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir instructed the military to expand the ground offensive against Hamas to additional areas in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, the IDF said Zamir was instructed to establish additional aid distribution sites for the Palestinian civilian population.\n\nOnly four aid sites have been established in Gaza, and not all of them are operational. Three are in southern Gaza\u2019s Rafah and one is adjacent to the Netzarim Corridor in the Central Strip, forcing many Gazans to embark on long and dangerous treks across a war zone in order to pick up boxes of aid to feed them for several days. The scheme managed by the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has come under criticism from aid groups who say it fails to adhere to humanitarian principles.\n\nThe initiative came under further scrutiny on Sunday when dozens of Palestinians were reportedly injured near one of the sites. Hamas authorities claimed the IDF opened fire on the Gazans, while the military vehemently denied having done so.\n\n",

      "title": "Hamas accepts Witkoff truce outline with amendments aimed at ending war",
      "content": "Hamas has agreed to the outline of a ceasefire deal drafted by US envoy Steve Witkoff, with amendments that include guarantees it would lead to negotiations aimed at permanently ending theIsraeli war on Gaza, Middle East Eye has learnt.\n\nThe 13-point outline with Hamas's changes, obtained by MEE through informedPalestiniansources, details terms the group has conditionally accepted.\n\nThese include a 60-day ceasefire, with US President Donald Trump proposed as guarantor ofIsrael\u2019s compliance.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Hamas has agreed to release 10 living Israeli captives and the remains of 18 others, in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners to be agreed upon.\n\nHowever, the group proposed that the releases be carried out in phases: four living captives would be freed on day one, two on day 30, and the final four on day 60. The remains of Israeli captives would also be returned in stages - six on day 10, another six on day 30, and the final six on day 50.\n\nHamas has also called for Israeli forces to withdraw to the positions they held prior to 2 March 2025.\n\nA Palestinian source close to the negotiations criticised Witkoff for pushing an initial\u00a0draft that lacked clarity and firm guarantees, telling MEE it reflects \u201cill intention\u201d and warning that it could cause the fragile talks to collapse.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the source said: \u201cWitkoff\u2019s insistence on releasing all the captives in the first week shows ill intention. Based on previous experience, the Israelis will simply return to full-scale war and sabotage the rest of the agreement.\u201d\n\n'Hamas feels Witkoff betrayed them twice'\n\n- Palestinian source\n\nHe accused the United States of focusing solely on the release of Israeli captives, while ignoring the continued killing of thousands of Palestinians and the spread of famine in Gaza.\n\n\u201cHamas feels Witkoff betrayed them twice,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cFirst, when Israel violated the US-guaranteed deal on 2 March by imposing an embargo on aid and then resuming full-scale war on 18 March - with the full support and cover of Witkoff and the US administration.\n\n\u201cAnd second, when Hamas released an American-Israeli soldier, Edan Alexander, in good faith, expecting humanitarian relief and a shift in the negotiating approach - which clearly did not happen.\u201d\n\nDuring the ceasefire talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly demanded that all 10 living captives and the 18 bodies be released in the first week - a condition Palestinian negotiators rejected over concerns Israel would resume its military campaign immediately afterward.\n\nWhile Hamas is demanding an Israeli military withdrawal to positions held before 2 March - short of a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip - the Palestinian source said Witkoff has failed to clarify exactly where Israeli forces would redeploy in his draft.\n\n\u201cWhat guarantees do the Palestinians have for an end to the war? Witkoff and the Israelis are not demonstrating any intention ...to bring the conflict to a close'\n\n- Palestinian source\n\n\u201cWithdrawal to where? Witkoff has been vague about this as well,\u201d the source told MEE.\n\nThe source also expressed concern about the lack of transparency regarding the proposed humanitarian aid mechanism, describing the overall framework as offering no viable path to ending the war.\n\n\u201cWhat guarantees do the Palestinians have for an end to the war? Witkoff and the Israelis are not demonstrating any intention - or offering a path - to bring the conflict to a close.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, earlier in the negotiations, Palestinian-American mediator Bishara Bahbah, who is working for the Trump administration, had reached a preliminary understanding with Hamas. The deal had initially been approved by Witkoff.\n\nHowever, following meetings with Israeli minister Ron Dermer and Netanyahu, Witkoff reportedly reversed his position and withdrew support for the agreement.\n\nAccording to theAxiosnews outlet, Witkoff\u2019s ceasefire proposal was \u201cfully coordinated with Israel and was a result of his meeting with Netanyahu\u2019s confidant Ron Dermer\u201d earlier this week.\n\nAxios also reported that Hamas pushed for language stipulating that if a permanent ceasefire deal is not reached within 60 days, the temporary truce would automatically be extended indefinitely.\n\nEarlier this week, Drop Site News reported that Witkoff\u2019s latest proposal was drafted in coordination with Netanyahu and explicitly avoids guaranteeing an end to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\n\nPalestinian negotiators have largely agreed to ceasefire terms set out in a deal signed on 17 January, which was violated by Israel on 18 March when it resumed its military campaign.\n\nIn the revised document submitted by Hamas, negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would begin immediately once the temporary truce takes effect.\n\nA key clause put forward by Hamas calls for an \u201cindependent committee of technocrats\u201d to administer Gaza\u2019s affairs following a permanent ceasefire - a provision that would see Hamas relinquish governing authority in the Strip.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever,reportssuggest that Witkoff and Netanyahu have sought to remove provisions that would see Hamas hand over administrative control in Gaza, raising concerns the war could resume after the 60-day period.\n\nOn Saturday, Witkoff dismissed Hamas\u2019s amendments as \u201ctotally unacceptable and only takes us backward.\u201d He insisted the group accept the existing framework for proximity talks scheduled to begin next week.\n\nEarlier the same day, Hamas said it welcomed Witkoff\u2019s proposal but emphasised the need for key modifications. A Hamas official told Al Jazeera the group had already agreed to an earlier version of the proposal a week earlier, only for Witkoff to return with an altered version that, according to Hamas, omitted crucial elements.\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept such a proposal as a baseline for negotiations,\u201d said senior Hamas official Basem Naim, citing the absence of guarantees for a 60-day ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and a full Israeli withdrawal.\n\nIn its formal response, Hamas also called for urgent humanitarian and reconstruction measures. These include immediate access to aid, coordinated through the United Nations and organisations such as the Red Crescent, in line with the agreement signed on 19 January 2025, when the first ceasefire deal was reached.\n\nDuring the negotiation phase, final plans would be developed to rebuild homes, public facilities, and critical infrastructure, alongside assistance for those affected by the war.\n\n\n\nThe group demanded the full restoration of \u201celectricity, water, sanitation, communications, and roads,\u201d as well as the reopening of hospitals, health centres, schools, and bakeries. Hamas also urged for unrestricted movement through the Rafah crossing with Egypt and the resumption of trade and commercial activity.\n\nIts proposal for a permanent ceasefire includes a \u201cfive-to-seven-year halt in hostilities\u201d, to be guaranteed by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar.\n\nWhile negotiations continue, Washington would remain committed to upholding the truce and ensuring the flow of humanitarian aid, with the goal of concluding talks within 60 days.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.Middle East Eye.

They\u2019re coming to see the destruction in Masafer Yatta, the way you are destroying the community, the settler violence,\u201d a voice off camera could be heard telling the officer, referring to the Palestinian village that \u201cNo Other Land\u201d covers.\n\nA Palestinian man was then seen telling the officer and a soldier standing with him, whose face was also covered, that the journalists were coming to his home and should be let through. But the officer refused.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you prevent the settlers when they came to burn the homes\u2026 attacking people?\u201d the man was seen telling the officer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to do this order? Why only for journalists who are holding cameras and phones?\u2026 I have so many videos of settlers coming to attack us, shooting people here, you do nothing. Why?\u201d\n\nEventually, the officer told the journalists that they were being kept out due to the need \u201cto keep the order in this area.\u201d\n\nBasel Adra, the Palestinian co-director of the film who lives in the area, said the military blocked the journalists from entering two Palestinian villages they had hoped to visit.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince \u201cNo Other Land\u201d gained notoriety, local villagers have faced an uptick in settler attacks, including in the villages ofTubaandJinba. Hamdan Ballal, another of the film\u2019s co-directors, wasattackedby settlers and then arrested in March, drawing global condemnation.\n\nPalestinians say the settlers operate with the tacit consent of the Israeli state, which carries out home demolitions and rarely prosecutes settlers for instances of violence against Palestinians. Locals have said the attacks are designed to intimidate them into fleeing their land.\n\nThe West Bank has seen a spike in violence since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel sparked the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the West Bank, the military has undertaken large-scale counterterrorism operations that have killed hundreds of people \u2014 the vast majority of them combatants, according to the IDF \u2014 and displaced tens of thousands.\n\n",

      "content": "The Times of Israel is liveblogging Monday\u2019s events as they unfold.\n\nA man who barricaded himself on the roof of a building after his wife was found stabbed to death has jumped to his death after nine hours, Israel Police says in a statement.\n\nPolice say negotiators conducted extensive negotiations to try to talk the suspect in the woman\u2019s murder down, but the man ultimately did not cooperate, police say.\n\nAccording to the Kan public broadcaster, the couple had recently separated.\n\nAccording to the Israel Women\u2019s Network, 14 women have been murdered in Israel since the start of the year, 13 of them by a partner or relative.\n\nThe Boulder Police Department says there are no fatalities in the attack on a rally for Israeli hostages yesterday.\n\n\u201cNo victims have died,\u201d the police department says in a statement.\n\nPolice said last night that one of the victims was in critical condition.\n\nThe suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was booked on murder charges in a local jail late last night. The charges are preliminary, have not been filed, and are subject to change. The reason for the discrepancy is still unclear.\n\nThe police department releases a mugshot of the suspect, who has a bandaged ear and bruising on his face.\n\nThe police department says it will hold a press conference on the attack later today and that more details are forthcoming.\n\nDAMASCUS/AMMAN, Syria/Jordan \u2014 The United States has given its blessing to a plan by Syria\u2019s new leadership to incorporate thousands of foreign jihadist former rebel fighters into the national army, provided that it does so transparently, US President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy says.\n\nThree Syrian defense officials say that under the plan, some 3,500 foreign fighters, mainly Uyghurs from China and neighboring countries, would join a newly-formed unit, the 84th Syrian army division, which would also include Syrians.\n\nAsked by Reuters in Damascus whether Washington approved the integration of foreign fighters into Syria\u2019s new military, Thomas Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey who was named Trump\u2019s special envoy to Syria last month, says: \u201cI would say there is an understanding, with transparency.\u201d\n\nHe says it was better to keep the fighters, many of whom are \u201cvery loyal\u201d to Syria\u2019s new administration, within a state project than to exclude them.\n\nThe fate of foreigners who joined Syria\u2019s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels during the 13-year war between rebel groups and President Bashar al-Assad has been one of the most fraught issues hindering a rapprochement with the West since HTS, a one-time offshoot of al Qaeda, toppled Assad and took power last year.\n\nAt least until early May, the United States had been demanding that the new leadership broadly exclude foreign fighters from the security forces.\n\nLebanese security forces have arrested a Hezbollah operative for allegedly spying for Israel, the Saudi Al Hadath news outlet reports.\n\nMahmoud Ayoub, the financial director at Ragheb Harb Hospital, was arrested today in the town of Harouf, in the Nabatieh district, Al Hadath reports.\n\nThe arrest comes weeks after the London-based Arabic Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported that at least 21 suspects were being held for spying for the Jewish state, including Mohammed Salah, the son of an elite Radwan Force commander and a well-known religious singer.\n\nUS Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee accuses major American news outlets of \u201ccontributing to the antisemitic climate\u201d that resulted in the recent attacks targeting Israeli embassy staffers in Washington and Israeli hostages activists in Colorado over the networks\u2019 coverage of yesterday\u2019s shooting of Gazans near an aid distribution site.\n\n\u201cWithout verification of any source other than Hamas and its collaborators, the New York Times, CNN, and Associated Press reported that a number of people seeking to receive humanitarian food boxes from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund were shot or killed by the Israeli Defense Forces,\u201d Huckabee says in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese reports were FALSE. Drone video and first-hand accounts clearly showed that there were no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting, no chaos,\u201d Huckabee asserts.\n\nIt is unclear what drone footage and first-hand accounts Huckabee is referring to. GHF released what it said was drone footage showing no incident at the site, but the clip was taken during daylight hours, while the incident that reportedly injured 31 Gazans took place at around 3 a.m.\n\nWhile the IDF has denied firing at Gazans near the GHF aid site yesterday, it has acknowledged firing in the air at Palestinians. Doctors Without Borders said its aid workers treated Palestinians who said Israeli soldiers were the ones who shot at them.\n\n\u201cThe only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States,\u201d Huckabee says.\n\n\u201cMedia sources who willingly parrot these libelous allegations should recant their fake news stories, apologize and pledge to practice actual reporting of fact instead of engaging in dangerous propaganda that assists the terror group Hamas as they continue to hold innocent hostages for over 600 days after butchering over 1,200 people on October 7th,\u201d he says, demanding an \u201cimmediate retraction\u201d by the American media sites.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates condemns what it says was a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d in Colorado targeting activists calling for the release of the Israeli hostages in Gaza.\n\nThe \u201cUAE expresses its strong condemnation of these criminal and terrorist acts and its permanent rejection of all forms of violence and terrorism targeting innocent people,\u201d a statement from its foreign ministry says, wishing a speedy recovery to the victims and expressing solidarity with the American people and their government.\n\nA Palestinian suspect who allegedly was planning to throw rocks at a highway in the West Bank was shot by Israeli troops a short while ago, the military says.\n\nTroops of the 636th Combat Intelligence Collection Unit had spotted the suspect near the village of Sinjil as he was attempting to hurl stones on a nearby road, the military says.\n\nThe IDF says the suspect threw two bottles with \u201cdangerous material\u201d in them at the forces, and the soldiers returned fire.\n\nIsraeli soldiers bar journalists from entering villages in the West Bank on a planned tour organized by the directors of the Oscar-winning movie \u201cNo Other Land.\u201d\n\nThe directors of the film, which focuses on Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, say they had invited the journalists on the tour today to interview residents about increasing settler violence in the area.\n\nIn a video posted on X by the film\u2019s co-director, Yuval Abraham, an Israeli soldier tells a group of international journalists there is \u201cno passage\u201d in the area because of a military order. Basel Adra, a Palestinian co-director of the film who lives in the area, says the military then blocked the journalists from entering two Palestinian villages they had hoped to visit.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military does not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Israeli military says it carried out a strike a short while ago against a Hamas command center embedded within a school-turned shelter in central Gaza\u2019s Deir al-Balah.\n\nAccording to Palestinian media, at least four people were killed in the strike on the Al-Aishiya school.\n\nThe IDF says that the command center was being used by Hamas operatives to plan and carry out attacks against troops and Israeli civilians.\n\nThe military says it took steps to mitigate civilian harm, including by using a precision munition, aerial surveillance, and other intelligence.\n\nA former senior Biden administration official says, \u201cIt is without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes\u201d in Gaza.\n\nMatthew Miller, who served as State Department spokesperson for the last two years of former US president Joe Biden\u2019s term, clarifies during a podcast interview withSky Newsthat he doesn\u2019t believe Israel is perpetrating a genocide in Gaza.\n\n\u201cThere are two ways to think about the commission of war crimes,\u201d Miller says. \u201cOne is if the state has pursued a policy of deliberately committing war crimes or is acting recklessly in a way that aids and abets war crimes. Is the state committing war crimes?\n\n\u201cThat, I think, is an open question. I think what is almost certainly not an open question is that there have been individual incidents that have been war crimes where Israeli soldiers, members of the Israeli military, have committed war crimes,\u201d he adds.\n\nIsrael has long denied that it is committing war crimes in Gaza, asserting that it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, while Hamas operates among civilians in order to maximize such figures.\n\nMiller acknowledges that there had been disagreements within the Biden administration about its Gaza war policy, including on whether to withhold weapons from Israel. However, he argues that doing so might have led Hamas to refrain from agreeing to a ceasefire.\n\n\u201cIt was clear to us in that period that there was a time when our public discussion of withholding weapons from Israel, as well as the protests on college campuses in the United States and the movement of some European countries to recognize the state of Palestine\u2026 All of those things together were leading the leadership of Hamas to conclude that they didn\u2019t need to agree to a ceasefire, they just needed to hold out for a little bit longer, and they could get what they always wanted,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I look back on\u2026 is in that intervening period between the end of May and the middle of January [2025], when thousands of Palestinians, innocent civilians were killed\u2026 was there more that we could have done to pressure the Israeli government to agree to that ceasefire? I think at times there probably was,\u201d Miller says.",

The death toll is expected to rise as operations intensify.\n\nThe International Organisation for Migration stated on Tuesday that nearly 180,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been forcibly displaced by recent Israeli military actions.\n\nA statement issued on behalf of the Global Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster condemned direct attacks on shelters, stating that such incidents had become \"common\".\n\nMeanwhile, ceasefire talks have been left in limbo after the United States presented a new proposal that reportedly lacked a guarantee to end the war and ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe White House said Israel had accepted the new proposal, while Hamas confirmed it was still reviewing it.\n\nThough the new proposal has not been made public, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the group was \"surprised\" by Israel's response, which he said was \"practically the opposite\" of what had been agreed and relayed to the American envoy via mediators earlier this week.\n\n\"The Israeli response contains no commitment to a ceasefire, no withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and keeps Israeli control over the aid entry mechanism,\" he said.\n\n\"What Netanyahu is offering is a bad proposal aimed at forcing our people into submission.\"\n\nHamas official Basem Naim echoed this view, telling Reuters that Israel\u2019s response \"fundamentally seeks to entrench the occupation and perpetuate policies of killing and starvation, even during what is supposed to be a period of temporary de-escalation\".\n\nHe added that the Hamas leadership was conducting a \"thorough and responsible review\" of the latest offer.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.Middle East Eye.

      "title": "Netanyahu says Boulder attack a direct result of \u2018blood libels\u2019 against Israel and Jews",
      "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday condemned the \u201cvicious terror attack\u201d in Boulder, Colorado against people demonstrating for the hostages held in Gaza, saying that a recent spate of violent attacks against Jews around the world was a direct result of \u201cblood libels against the Jewish state and people.\u201d\n\nAt least eight people were wounded Sunday in Boulder, including one person in critical condition, when themarchers were attackedby a man shouting \u201cend Zionists,\u201d who fired a makeshift flamethrower and threw firebombs at them. The incident occurred on the eve of the Jewish festival of Shavuot.\n\n\u201cThis attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,\u201d Netanyahu said in a relatively rare statement on a Jewish holiday.\n\n\u201cI trust the United States authorities to prosecute the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law and do everything possible to prevent future attacks against innocent civilians,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\n\u201cThe antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments echoed those of an earlier statement by Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar, who blamed the \u201cterrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews\u201d on \u201cpure antisemitism fueled by the blood libels spread in the media.\u201d\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced Sunday\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cWe are all horrified by the violent terror attack in Colorado against peaceful protesters who were simply calling for the release of our hostage,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nThe Hostage Families Forum said they were heartbroken about the news of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the tragic attack in Colorado and extend our deepest support to all those affected. Our thoughts are with the injured, their loved ones, and the entire community shaken by this senseless act of violence,\u201d the Forum said.\n\n\u201cFor over 600 days, this community \u2014 along with so many others around the world \u2014 has stood with us, marching, praying, and raising its voice for the hostages still held in Gaza. Today, we stand with you \u2014 with care, with solidarity, and with deep appreciation for your unwavering support.\u201d\n\nAmbassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.\n\n\u201cTerrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border \u2014 it is already burning the streets of America,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe incident, which the FBI said it was investigating as an act of terrorism, marked the second major attack against a Jewish gathering in the US in recent weeks after two Israeli embassy staffers were shot and killed outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC.\n\nFour women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.\n\nThe suspect is in custody and was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn\u2019t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.\n\nWitnesses told investigators that Soliman attacked the demonstrators with a \u201cmakeshift flamethrower\u201d and threw an incendiary device, FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek said at a press conference. Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the suspect hurled Molotov cocktails at the demonstrators.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,\u201d Michalek said.\n\nIn footage said to be from the scene of the attack, a shirtless man screamed \u201cEnd Zionists\u201d while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails. The man also shouted, \u201cPalestine is free.\u201d\n\nThe attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized during Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 assault on Israel in which 251 people were taken hostage and some 1,200 killed.\n\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 58 hostages, including 57 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF, and 20 are believed to be alive. There are grave concerns for the well-being of three others, Israeli officials have said.\n\nIn a statement, Run for Their Lives said the walks have been held every week since then for the hostages, \u201cwithout any violent incidents until today.\u201d\n\nUS officials also condemned the attack and vowed action.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the Boulder incident as a \u201ctargeted terror attack,\u201d while Attorney General Pam Bondi said \u201cFBI agents are on the ground in Colorado following what appears to be a horrific antisemitic attack.\u201d\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.\n\n\u201cTonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror,\u201d Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cOnce again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.\n\nColorado Governor Jared Polis, who is also Jewish, posted on social media that it was \u201cunfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder.\u201d\n\nSeveral organizations also decried the violence.\n\n\u201cOur community was targeted in a violent, antisemitic attack,\u201d the Israeli-American Council said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on all of us \u2014 and we will not stay silent.\u201d\n\nFBI chief Kash Patel described Sunday\u2019s incident as \u201ca targeted terror attack,\u201d while Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser labeled it \u201ca hate crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado,\u201d Weiser said.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who \u201cillegally overstayed (his) visa.\u201d\n\nAcross the US, the New York Police Department said it has upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.\n\n",

      "title": "Netanyahu 'unsettled' by Macron's push to recognise Palestinian statehood",
      "content": "A prominentIsraelidiplomat has told Middle East Eye thatFrenchPresident Emmanuel Macron\u2019s push to recognisePalestinianstatehood \u201cis serious and has the backing of most of the European Union andSaudi Arabia\u201d.\n\nAlon Pinkas, who was an adviser to four Israeli foreign ministers and served as the country\u2019s consul general in New York, said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cis unsettled because he knows Donald Trump\u2019s support is brittle and tentative\u201d.\n\n\u201cBoth the EU and theUSwill be looking for something they can work together on and alleviate tensions,\u201d Pinkas said.\n\n\u201cYou need one or two European leaders to placate Trump and let him feel like it\u2019s his idea.\u201d\n\nUnlike 147 of the 193 United Nations member states, France does not recognise the state of Palestine, a position it shares with other western nations including theUK, US and Australia.\n\nBut France is now pushing for Australian and European powers, including the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands, to recognise Palestinian statehood at a UN conference it is co-hosting with Saudi Arabia in New York later this month.\n\nParis hopes that recognition of Palestinian statehood will kickstart a peace process and help accelerate momentum for a two-state solution.\n\nPinkas, a longstanding critic of Netanyahu, said he believed Macron\u2019s push for Palestinian statehood was also related to \u201cgeneral fatigue and disillusionment with Israel over its intransigence on everything\u201d.\n\nLast year, Spain, Norway and Ireland agreed to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael condemns such moves as rewarding the actions of Palestinian armed groups.\n\nIn recent weeks, European nations, including the UK and France, have taken a much firmer rhetorical line with Israel, while continuing to support it as its war on Gaza continues.\n\n'The humanitarian blockade is creating a situation that is untenable on the ground'\n\n-President Emmanuel Macron\n\nPinkas told MEE he thought that the EU\u2019s position on the war had not really changed, it has simply become \u201cunequivocal and public\u201d.\n\nHe said that while there was no meaningful domestic support in Israel or in the Knesset for Palestinian statehood, the international community\u2019s pitch to Israel over ending the war should be that \u201cwe are your friends, we want you to succeed, this cannot go on... Netanyahu is driving you to unmitigated and irreparable disaster. Wake up, we are here to help.\"\n\nAt a press conference in Singapore on Friday, Macron said France was committed to working towards a political solution, as he reiterated his support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\n\u201cThe humanitarian blockade is creating a situation that is untenable on the ground,\u201d Macron said.\n\n\u201cAnd so, if there is no response that meets the humanitarian situation in the coming hours and days, obviously, we will have to toughen our collective position,\u201d he said, adding that France might consider applying sanctions against Israeli settlers.\n\nWhile diplomats say the French president is leaning towards recognition of a Palestinian state, Paris has yet to take any concrete steps to target Israel in its war on Gaza.\n\nMacron does seem to enjoy a good relationship with US President Donald Trump, who Pinkas said could work with EU nations to put pressure on Israel. Asked about a viral video that appeared to show the French president being slapped by his wife Brigitte, Trumpsaid: \"He's fine, they're fine. They're two really good people, I know them very well.\"\n\nIsrael claimed to have partially ended an 11-week long aid blockade on Gaza last week, but barely any aid has entered the largely destroyed Palestinian enclave and civilians have been killed at the new US-Israel sponsored aid distribution sites, which see Palestinians crammed into tight spaces between fences.\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry said the assertion that there was a humanitarian blockade of Gaza was \u201ca blatant lie\u201d.\n\nIt said nearly 900 aid trucks had entered the Gaza since the blockade was eased and that the new US-backed system had distributed two million meals and thousands of aid packages.\n\n\u201cBut instead of applying pressure on the jihadist terrorists, Macron wants to reward them with a Palestinian state,\u201d the Israeli ministry said in a statement reported by Reuters.\n\nThe charity Islamic Relief condemned the new aid system in a statement on Monday, saying that \u201cmassacres of people trying to get food aid must not go without consequence\u201d.\n\n\u201cThree months since Israel tightened its total siege of Gaza, dozens of Palestinian children, babies and elderly people have starved to death and desperate parents are being shot and killed as they try to get food aid at new militarised distribution sites,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cMany more people across Gaza will soon die from hunger and disease unless international governments urgently put meaningful pressure on Israel to fully end its siege, reopen all crossings and allow large-scale, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access,\u201d Islamic Relief said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.Middle East Eye.

      "title": "Iran poised to dismiss nuclear proposal presented by US, Iranian diplomat says",
      "content": "DUBAI (Reuters) \u2014 Iran is poised to reject a US proposal to end a decades-old nuclear dispute, an Iranian diplomat said on Monday, dismissing it as a \u201cnon-starter\u201d that fails to address Tehran\u2019s interests or soften Washington\u2019s stance on uranium enrichment.\n\n\u201cIran is drafting a negative response to the US proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer,\u201d the senior diplomat, who is close to Iran\u2019s negotiating team, told Reuters.\n\nThe US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was on a short visit to Tehran and has been mediating talks between Tehran and Washington.\n\nAfter five rounds of discussions between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, several obstacles remain.\n\nAmong them are Iran\u2019s rejection of a US demand that it commit to scrapping uranium enrichment and its refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium \u2014 possible raw material for nuclear bombs.\n\nThe United States, Israel and Western countries have long accused Iran \u2014 which vows to destroy Israel \u2014 of seeking nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran has repeatedly denied, insisting it needs uranium for civilian power production. However, Iran has been enriching uranium up to 60%, a level that has no civilian uses and is just below weapons grade.\n\nIt has also obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and has expanded its ballistic missile capabilities, while several officials have warned that it could pursue the bomb.\n\nWashington\u2019s proposal for a deal came after leakedUN reports this weekend saidIran had stepped up production of highly enriched uranium and carried out secretive nuclear activities.\n\n\u201cIn this proposal, the US stance on enrichment on Iranian soil remains unchanged, and there is no clear explanation regarding the lifting of sanctions,\u201d said the diplomat, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nAraghchi said Tehran would formally respond to the proposal soon.\n\nTehran demands the immediate removal of all US-imposed curbs that impair its oil-based economy. But the US says nuclear-related sanctions should be removed in phases.\n\nDozens of institutions vital to Iran\u2019s economy, including its central bank and national oil company, have been blacklisted since 2018 for, according to Washington, \u201csupporting terrorism or weapons proliferation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s revival of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Tehran since his return to the White House in January has included tightening\u00a0sanctions and threatening\u00a0to bomb Iran if\u00a0the\u00a0negotiations yield no deal.\n\nDuring his first term\u00a0in 2018, Trump ditched Tehran\u2019s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran\u2019s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the pact\u2019s limits.\n\nUnder the deal, Iran had until 2018 curbed its sensitive nuclear work in return for relief from US, EU and UN economic sanctions.\n\nThe diplomat said the assessment of \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear negotiations committee,\u201d under the supervision of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was that the US proposal was \u201ccompletely one-sided\u201d and could not serve Tehran\u2019s interests.\n\nTherefore, the diplomat said, Tehran considers this proposal a \u201cnon-starter\u201d and believes it unilaterally attempts to impose a \u201cbad deal\u201d on Iran through excessive demands.\n\nThe stakes are high for both sides. Trump wants to curtail Tehran\u2019s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. Iran\u2019s clerical establishment, for its part, wants to be rid of the devastating sanctions.\n\nIran says it is ready to accept some limits on enrichment but needs watertight guarantees that Washington would not renege on a future nuclear accord.\n\nTwo Iranian officials told Reuters last week that Iran could pause uranium enrichment if the US released frozen Iranian funds and recognized Tehran\u2019s right to refine uranium for civilian use under a \u201cpolitical deal\u201d that could lead to a broader nuclear accord.\n\nIsrael sees Iran\u2019s nuclear program as an existential threat and says it would never allow Tehran to obtain nuclear weapons.\n\nAraghchi, in a joint news conference with his Egyptian counterpart in Cairo, said: \u201cI do not think Israel will commit such a mistake as to attack Iran.\u201d\n\nTehran\u2019s regional influence has meanwhile been diminished by military setbacks suffered by its forces and those of its allies in the Shi\u2019ite-dominated \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d which includes Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and Iraqi militias.\n\nIn April, Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister delivered a blunt message to Iranian officials to take Trump\u2019s offer of a new deal seriously as a way to avoid the risk of war with Israel.\n\n",

      "title": "Hamas is studying another US ceasefire proposal for Gaza. What has changed?",
      "content": "Hamas said on Thursday it was studying aGazaceasefire proposal byUSenvoy Steve Witkoff, which Israel announced it had accepted, as starvation stalks the enclave andIsraelramps up its air strikes.\n\n\"The leadership of the Hamas movement has received Witkoff's new proposal from the mediators and is currently studying it responsibly, in a manner that serves the interests of our people, provides relief, and achieves a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Hamas said.\n\nWitkoff sounded an optimistic note speaking at the White House on Wednesday, saying, \u201cI have some very good feelings about getting to\u2026 a temporary ceasefire and a long-term, peaceful resolution of that conflict.\u201d\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had accepted a new ceasefire proposal from Witkoff, but added that Hamas had not yet accepted.\n\nHowever, reports that Israel and Hamas were nearing an agreement have occurred regularly throughout the 18 months of war, only to wither a few days later.\n\nHamas and Israel reached a brief three-stage ceasefire in January, but the dealcollapsedin March after Israel took back several of its captives and resumed bombing Gaza, walking away from the deal before talks with Hamas on a permanent end to the war could start.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has broken with Israel on bombing the Houthis, negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran, and lifting sanctions onSyria, it has given Israel full backing to wage war on Gaza.\n\nAccording to Axios, the latest Witkoff proposal is similar to the one Israel broke in March.\n\nIt calls for the release of captives in return for 60 days of no fighting.\n\nThe deal would set a timeline for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiating a permanent end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli troops.\n\nSeveral factors have changed since then, but it's unclear how they might impact the talks.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration began to rely on a new intermediary with Hamas, Palestinian-American businessman Bishara Bahbah.\n\nThe national chairman for Arab Americans for Trump established a backchannel for Hamas directly to the Trump administration that led to the release of US-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander from captivity earlier this month.\n\nDespite the new diplomatic shake-up, the main roadblock to a deal has not changed.\n\nHamas wants a guarantee that, in return for returning the 20 captives believed to be alive, Israel will agree to a permanent end to the war.\n\nIsraeli media reported on Thursday that Netanyahu was prepared to move forward with a temporary truce.\n\nNetanyahu has regularly insisted on the right to resume fighting and has pledged to totally disarm and eliminate Hamas.\n\nSpeaking in May, Netanyahu said for the first time that one of his conditions for ending the war was the right to enact aplanfloated earlier this year by Trump, which called for the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nIsrael did withdraw from some points in Gaza in January and February, but it has established the Netzarim Corridor to deploy troops from east to west of Gaza quickly.\n\nHamas is\u00a0unlikely to forget\u00a0that Israel quickly reoccupied the enclave in March with little public pressure\u00a0not to\u00a0from the US, orEgyptandQatar, the two Arab mediators.\n\nIsrael's military said on Monday it wants to control 75 percent of Gaza and force roughly two million Palestinians there into a narrow zone in the south near the Egyptian border.\n\nThere was some confusion on Monday after media reports said that Hamas had agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposed by Witkoff, only for Israel to deny the offer was on the table.\n\nTalks are ongoing as Gaza descends into anarchy and starvation. Israel has been blockading the entry of all food, water, and medicine into the enclave until recently.\n\nThe US and Israel established a controversial organisation in May dubbed the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to distribute aid. Its aid centre in Rafah, staffed by American mercenaries, was overrun with thousands of starving Palestinians.\n\nThe Israeli military opened fire on the crowd, and images on social media showed Palestinians boxed into narrow fences to obtain aid.\n\nThe foundation has been slammed by the UN and other aid groups for militarising aid. On\u00a0Wednesday, four Palestinians died storming a UN warehouse in search of food.\n\nAt least 44 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes across Gaza on Thursday. The total death toll since the war began in October 2023 has surpassed 54,000.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.Middle East Eye.

      "title": "Liberal mayor, anti-EU Holocaust revisionist both claim victory in Poland election",
      "content": "Both candidates in Poland\u2019s runoff presidential election on Sunday claimed victory after an exit poll showed Warsaw\u2019s pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski just 0.6% ahead of his rival, right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki, who has made Holocaust revisionism part of his campaign.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2026 by a whisker,\u201d Trzaskowski, 53, who is backed by the ruling Civic Coalition party, told supporters after the Ipsos poll showed him narrowly ahead with 50.3 percent.\n\nNawrocki, 42, who is supported by Poland\u2019s outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda and US President Donald Trump, was at 49.7 percent. \u201cTonight we will win,\u201d Nawrocki told his election night rally. \u201cWe will win and we will save Poland.\u201d\n\nThe Ipsos exit poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, and the final vote is likely to change somewhat, making the result still too close to call.\n\nThe state electoral commission was expected to release the final vote count on Monday, though the result could be known sooner.\n\nTherunofffollows a tightly contested first round on May 18, in which Trzaskowski won just over 31% and Nawrocki nearly 30%, eliminating 11 other candidates.\n\nFar-right candidates S\u0142awomir Mentzen and Grzegorz Braun came in third and fourth, giving Nawrocki a larger pool of right-wing voters to draw on in the runoff.\n\nNawrocki, who has the support of Trump, hasn\u2019t wasted time courting those voters. He signed a list of Mentzen\u2019s demands, such as refusing to ratify Ukraine\u2019s entry to NATO, sending Polish soldiers to Ukraine, or expanding EU powers.\n\nHe has also sought favor from Braun, who made antisemitism a feature of his campaign, asking his rivals in a televised debate last month what they planned to do about the \u201cJudaization\u201d of Poland. In 2023, Braun used a fire extinguisher to blow out Hanukkah candles in parliament and violently stormed a lecture by Grabowski. This year he disrupted a moment of silence for the Holocaust to denounce \u201cJewish genocide in Gaza.\u201d His campaign posters showed him posing with a fire extinguisher.\n\nNawrocki told Braun that he would fight \u201call the disgusting attacks\u201d on Poland by Holocaust scholars, and had previously promised to end the tradition of lighting Hanukkah candles in the presidential palace.\n\nA victory for Nawrocki would embolden the populist Law and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, and could lead to fresh parliamentary elections.\n\nThe candidacy of Nawrocki, an amateur boxer, has been clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and participation in a violent street battle. He denies the criminal links but acknowledges having taken part in \u201cnoble\u201d fights. The revelations have not appeared to dent his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.\n\nMany Nawrocki supporters want stricter curbs on immigration and advocate for conservative values and more sovereignty for the country within the European Union.\n\n\u201cWe should not give in to European pressure,\u201d 40-year-old Agnieszka Prokopiuk, a homemaker, said before the vote.\n\n\u201cWe need to make our own way,\u201d she told AFP in the eastern city of Biala Podlaska.\n\nA victory for Trzaskowski would be a major boost for the progressive agenda of the government led by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. It could mean significant social changes such as the introduction of civil partnerships for same-sex couples and an easing of a near-total ban on abortion.\n\nTusk, a former European Council president, said these elections \u201cwere particularly important\u201d after he voted in the seaport of Sopot.\n\nKatarzyna Malek, a 29-year-old voter in Warsaw, cast her ballot in the first round for a left-wing candidate but went for Trzaskowski on Sunday, viewing him as more competent and more likely to pursue stronger ties with foreign partners and lower social tensions.\n\n\u201cI hope there will be less division, that maybe there will be more dialogue,\u201d she said.\n\nCivic Coalition, which backed Trzaskowski, traditionally appeals to more liberal-minded Poles who mainly live in cities or bigger towns. Law and Justice, which backed Nawrocki, has traditionally enjoyed support in small towns and rural areas, especially in Poland\u2019s south and east. These areas are typically poorer and more socially conservative than larger cities, creating a sense of exclusion that the populist party has tapped into.\n\nThe president in Poland, a fast-growing economy of 38 million people, has the power to veto legislation and is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president wields another power that can influence historical research: signing off on awarding professorships.\n\nDuda, who is aligned with Law and Justice,refusedin 2019 to appoint Michal Bilewicz, a Jewish researcher of antisemitism, as a full professor at the University of Warsaw.\n\nIt was only in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union fell, that Poland began efforts to reconcile with the murder of 3 million Jews there and the intertwining of Jewish and Polish history.\n\nBut many projects of \u201cmemory activism\u201d were cut short by the Law and Justice government, which isolated Poland from the EU and was scrutinized for undermining democratic norms and tightening government control over the judiciary, the media and Polish history.\n\nNawrocki heads the Institute of National Remembrance, known for advancing the right-wing government\u2019s narratives, which glorified Polish victimhood and resistance to the Nazis while delegitimizing research on Polish antisemitism or Poles who killed Jews.\n\nIn 2018, the country passed a law that outlawed accusing Poland or the Polish people of complicity in Nazi crimes. Although the infraction was downgraded from a crime punishable with three years in prison to a civil offense, critics say it had a chilling effect on historical research.\n\n",

It is genocide,\" Harris told an opposition lawmaker during a heated exchange in parliament, known as the theD\u00e1il.\n\nCatherine Connolly, an independent, accused the government of not doing enough to punish Israel for its 19-month-long war on Gaza, which has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted and sickened, sickened - watching children dying on our television screens and every day I come to work, and work with all the people in here to do our best to show leadership at a time of horrific conflict,\" Harris said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to support the people of Palestine and the only chamber I ever go into in the entire world where people don\u2019t acknowledge that Ireland, the government, the people of Ireland, are standing with the people of Palestine, standing up for human rights, standing up for international law, is here when you get up and distort - with your ideology - the actions of this government.\"\n\nIreland recognised Palestinian statehood one year ago, and in January, it joined South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nOn Thursday, Harris said that a bill banning trade with goods from Israeli settlements - deemed illegal under international law - would move to the foreign affairs committee next month, the Irish Times said.\n\nThe government is also under pressure tohelp remove the Central Bank\u2019s role in permitting the sale of Israel bonds in the EU, and to stop any flights over Ireland that may be carrying weapons to Israel, the paper reported.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the people of this country.

      "content": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) \u2014 Russian and Ukrainian officials are due to sit down on Monday in the Turkish city of Istanbul for their second round of direct peace talks since 2022, but the two sides are still far apart on how to end the war and the fighting is stepping up.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has demanded that Russia and Ukraine make peace, but so far they have not and the White House has repeatedly warned the United States will \u201cwalk away\u201d from the war if the two sides are too stubborn to reach a peace deal.\n\nThe first round of talks on May 16 yielded the biggest prisoner swap of the war, but no sign of peace, or even a ceasefire, as both sides merely set out their own opening negotiating positions.\n\nAfter keeping the world guessing on whether Ukraine would even turn up for the second round, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Defense Minister Rustem Umerov would meet with Russian officials in Istanbul.\n\nThe Russian delegation will be headed by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky, who after the first round invoked French general and statesman Napoleon Bonaparte to assert that war and negotiations should always be conducted at the same time.\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine launched one of its most ambitious attacks of the war, targeting Russian nuclear-capable long-range bombers in Siberia and other military bases, while the Kremlin launched 472 drones at Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s air force said, the highest nightly total of the war.\n\nThe idea of direct talks was first proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin after Ukraine and European powers demanded that he agree to a ceasefire which the Kremlin dismissed.\n\nPutin said Russia would draft a memorandum setting out the broad contours of a possible peace accord and only then discuss a ceasefire.\n\nKyiv said over the weekend it was still waiting for a draft memorandum from the Russian side.\n\nMedinsky, the lead Kremlin negotiator, said on Sunday that Moscow had received Ukraine\u2019s draft memorandum and told Russia\u2019s RIA news agency the Kremlin would react to it on Monday.\n\nAccording to Trump envoy Keith Kellogg, the two sides will in Turkey present their respective documents outlining their ideas for peace terms, though it is clear that after three years of war Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart.\n\nKellogg has indicated that the US will be involved in the talks and that even representatives from Britain, France and Germany will be too, though it was not clear at what level the United States would be represented.\n\nUkraine\u2019s delegation will also include its deputy foreign minister, as well as several military and intelligence officials, according to an executive order by Zelensky on Sunday.\n\nIn June last year, Putin set out his opening terms for an immediate end to the war: Ukraine must drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw all of its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.\n\nUkrainian negotiators in Istanbul will present to the Russian side a proposed roadmap for reaching a lasting peace settlement, according to a copy of the document seen by Reuters.\n\nAccording to the document, there will be no restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s military strength after a peace deal is struck, no international recognition of Russian sovereignty over parts of Ukraine taken by Moscow\u2019s forces, and no reparations for Ukraine.\n\nThe document also stated that the current location of the front line will be the starting point for negotiations about territory.\n\nRussia currently controls a little under one-fifth of Ukraine, or about 113,100 square km, about the same size as the US state of Ohio.\n\nPutin ordered tens of thousands of troops to invade Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops. The United States says over 1.2 million people have been killed and injured in the war since 2022.\n\nTrump has called Putin \u201ccrazy\u201d and berated Zelensky in public in the Oval Office, but the US president has also said that he thinks peace is achievable and that if Putin delays, then he could impose tough sanctions on Russia.\n\n",

      "content": "Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan will visit the occupied West Bank this weekend, making him the highest rankingSaudiofficial to visit in almost 60 years, the Palestinian Authority (PA) revealed on Friday.\n\nBin Farhan will lead a ministerial delegation comprised of his counterparts inJordan,Egypt, and other Arab nations, the Palestinian ambassador to Saudi Arabia told local media, adding that the trip is intended to convey the centrality of the Palestinian cause to Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe move appears similar to the trip bin Farhan organised to Washington in the early months ofIsrael's war on Gaza, in a bid to showcase a united Arab front in support of a ceasefire.\n\nIt also appears to be an attempt at lending credibility to the PA as an alternative to Hamas in Gaza, despite the PA's plummeting popularity among Palestinians.\n\nThe trip is rare and unusual, given that the last time a Saudi official visited Ramallah, he had been appointed a non-resident ambassador to Palestine.\n\nNayef al-Sudairi arrived\u00a0just weeks before the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel, and before him, King Faisal had visited in 1966.\n\nThose attacks were intended to and indeed derailed Saudi-Israeli normalisation talks, Hamas officials revealed over the course of the war.\n\nWith the kingdom being the de facto leader of the Arab world, it can set an agenda with the kind of influence few of its neighbours possess - and normalising with Israel would have likely dashed ambitions for Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported on Friday evening that Israel would block Farhan and his delegation's visit. Israel has control of the occupied West Bank's land border with Jordan.\n\nIf Israel follows through on the threat, it could further strain relations with Riyadh and other regional countries.\n\nSince 2023, Saudi Arabia has made it clear that normalisation would only be pursued with a clear pathway to a Palestinian state.\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called Israel's now 19-month-long war on Gaza a \"genocide\", echoing assessments by the United Nations and countless rights organisations, among other leading historians and experts.\n\nMore than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, with some experts believing the figure to be a significant undercount.\n\nNext month, a meeting in New York co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France is expected to outline the necessity of establishing a Palestinian state, and rebuild support for the concept of the two-state solution, a plan outlined in the 1993 Oslo Accords.\n\nSeveral European nations have recently recognised the state of Palestine, including Ireland, Spain, and Norway.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.Middle East Eye.

      "content": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki, who madeHolocaust revisionismpart of his campaign, won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of the votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.\n\nThe race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.\n\nAn early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.\n\nThe outcome suggests that Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by US President Donald Trump.\n\nMost day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president\u2019s role is not merely ceremonial.\n\nThe office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.\n\nRelated:Poland to vote for next president, with Holocaust history an apparent item on the ballot\n\nNawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on August 6.\n\nUnder the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn\u2019t been able to fulfill certain of Tusk\u2019s electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.\n\nBut Duda\u2019s veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.\n\nNow it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.\n\nSome observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.\n\nNawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.\n\nThe party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party\u2019s eight years of rule.\n\nThe strategy clearly worked.\n\nNawrocki campaigned under the slogan \u201cPoland first, Poles first\u201d.\n\nNawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives, which glorified Polish victimhood and resistance to the Nazis during World War Two while delegitimizing research on Polish antisemitism or Poles who killed Jews.\n\nHe led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.\n\nNawrocki\u2019s candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \u201cnoble\u201d fights in his life. The revelations did not seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.\n\nTrump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland\u2019s president.\n\nHe welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the US Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.\n\nThe US has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.\n\nA common refrain from Nawrocki\u2019s supporters is that he will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. US flags often appeared at Nawrocki\u2019s rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.\n\nNawrocki has also echoed some of Trump\u2019s language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland\u2019s support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.\n\n",

      "title": "War on Gaza: The world is turning, but Israel has yet to reckon with its crimes",
      "content": "As the father of a four-year-old daughter and a newborn baby, as I watch the international response to thegenocide in Gaza, I cannot help but wonder: at what age will my children cease to be considered children, and their lives be deemed less important?\n\nThe world is shocked at the number of children being killed andstarved in Gaza, but there remains no substantive critique of whatIsraelhas done over these past 19 months to allPalestiniansin Gaza. The threshold of demands has been lowered to merely alleviating the humanitarian crisis.\n\nIsrael has succeeded in destroying Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, healthcare system, municipalities, education networks, families, mosques and churches - in short, every framework that organised human life.\n\nBut now, having exhausted its \u201ctarget bank\u201d and with nothing left to bomb, Israel is striking refugee tent camps andburning people alive. Such cruelty, along with the passage of time and mounting international pressure, have led to a turning point, both globally and within Israeli society.\n\nDespite the support provided to Israel by two successiveUSpresidents and the consensus among Democrats and Republicans alike to give Israel a free hand, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed to defeat Hamas or secure the release of the remaining hostages.\n\nAcross the spectrum, Israel\u2019s political establishment adopted a revenge narrative from day one, priming the Israeli public to be complicit in its forthcoming crimes.\n\nIsrael\u2019s failure was not its inability to free the hostages or disarm Hamas. As early asNovember 2023, Israel could have reached a deal to free all the hostages, while various proposals have been advanced to settle the conflict, including bringing in other entities, such as the Palestinian Authority, to govern Gaza.\n\nBut Israel\u2019s real objective is clear: to empty Gaza of its population. As Finance MinisterBezalel Smotrich\u2019s recent statements candidly reveal, the true aim of the war is to conquer Gaza, expel its Palestinian residents, and occupy the territory. This was the original intention all along.\n\nThis has resulted in two strategic failures for Israel. Firstly, it has failed to compelEgyptandJordanto participate in this scheme and accept Palestinian refugees.\n\nIsrael\u2019s second failure is moral. The government and Israeli society itself have normalised a narrative of genocide and ethnic cleansing, defending this stance with euphemisms like \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d and \u201cencouraging relocation\u201d.\n\nFollow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war\n\nNow, with the intensification ofinternational criticism, cracks have begun to appear in the Israeli consensus. The insistence of thousands of activists and media figures worldwide - Palestinian and non-Palestinian alike - to continue speaking out on Gaza has generated sufficient pressure to make an impact.\n\nThis initially affected Israeli tourists, who discovered that most people around the world view genocide as an unforgivable atrocity, prompting Israel\u2019s foreign ministry to remind Israelis tosuppress national symbolsabroad, fuelling a silent boycott of Israeli academics and cultural figures.\n\nThe West will scavenge for Israeli movements and leaders who speak out against the war, without offering a genuine moral alternative\n\nWe are now seeing a shift in the tone of western foreign policies - late, but significant. The US administration\u2019s decision to hold direct negotiations with Hamas to secure the release of dual citizenEdan Alexanderreinforced the feeling among Israelis that their government is not genuinely interested in advancing a hostage deal.\n\nConversely, the US has grown weary of Israel, as evidenced by President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East tourskipping over\u00a0Israel.\n\nThe shift in Israel\u2019s global standing was further evidenced by a recent Financial Timeseditorialtitled \u201cThe West\u2019s shameful silence on Gaza\u201d, as European threats to suspend trade agreements have begun to bite.\n\nFrench President Emmanual Macron has shifted his tone toward overt criticism, saying this week that European nations\u00a0must\u00a0\u201charden the collective position\u201d\u00a0against Israel over Gaza\u2019s worsening humanitarian crisis. Even Germany's new chancellor said Berlin would not export weapons used to break humanitarian law, in a break from 19 months of loyal support for Israel's war.\n\nWithin Israel itself, one of the most striking signs of fracture came in a recent statement from Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats party,who declared: \u201cA sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not give itself the aim of expelling populations.\u201d\n\nGolan, a former deputy militarychief of staff, wasdisciplinedtwo decades ago for employing the banned \u201cneighbour procedure\u201d in field operations, a method in which civilians are used to persuade their neighbours to surrender to the army.\n\nThis context suggests that Golan is no ethical pacifist. Rather, like many former Israeli generals, he realises that Israel is on its way to becoming a pariah state, incapable of surviving in the Middle East without western support.\n\nIndeed, many Israelis who were once fervent supporters of the war now frame the Gaza genocide as a political gambit for Netanyahu\u2019s survival. Yet this was a war many in Israeli society wanted andsupported, including Golan himself.\n\nToday, public discourse in Israel oscillates between those who wish to continue the genocide, and those who are worried about the repercussions. This fracture is a byproduct of Israel\u2019s failure to ethnically cleanse Gaza, and the fact that it will have to face armed resistance for many years to come.\n\nAmid this backdrop, Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners speak of returning settlements to Gaza, a move that would place Israel squarely on the blacklist of pariah states.\n\nSadly, neither Golan nor others in Israel\u2019s political and civil spheres - not even those who oppose the war - are prepared to admit that the state has carried out a genocide. But still, the public backlash against Golan\u2019s remarks took its toll: days later, in atelevised interview, he declared that Israel \u201chas not committed war crimes in Gaza\u201d.\n\nDuring a visit to the southern city of Beersheba on Tuesday, angry Zionist crowdsheckled and booedGolan, who - despite retracting his earlier statements - is now being portrayed around the world as a supposed alternative to Netanyahu, even though he offers no real alternative.\n\nRegrettably, this is likely to be the future: the West will scavenge for Israeli movements and leaders who speak out against the war, without offering a genuine moral alternative. Similar to the periods after the First and Second Intifadas, millions of dollars will flow into Israel\u2019s \u201cpeace industry\u201d, which will talk about Arabs and Jews living together, without confronting the essential political questions that brought us to this reality.\n\nIn the meantime, we must support every statement and initiative that contributes to ending the war - because what matters now is Gaza, and not only the children of Gaza, but also the youths, the women, the men and the elderly.\n\nTo prevent further\u00a0disaster, we must demand more from Israelis, including a real acknowledgment of their actions over the past 600 days.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.Middle East Eye.
