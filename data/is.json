    "content": "SHTULA – Shula Giladi, known as Shula from Shtula, used to welcome tourists into her northern Israel home with Kurdish delicacies and stories of her family’s life in Kurdistan a century ago.\n\nThen the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah began firing anti-tank missiles, rockets and explosive drones across the border, damaging her home and hundreds of others’.\n\nNow, the displaced 72-year-old jokes wryly that she is known as Shula with a suitcase.\n\nGiladi’s house sits less than 500 meters (1640 feet) from the Lebanese border, which has remained quiet since late November, when a ceasefire was reached to end the Iran-backed group’s 13-month campaign of terror.\n\nBut six months after the fighting stopped, many, like Giladi, are still living with its effects, their homes still in disrepair and their communities scattered.\n\nSitting with The Times of Israel in her garden, once lush and verdant but now in ruins, the former host was unable to offer a glass of water or even the use of a bathroom.\n\nGiladi hopes to move back once the repairs are finished, but she is now waiting for appraisers to submit reports and for the government to approve her expenses, with no idea how long the whole process will take.\n\n“I’ve dropped the word ‘return’ from my lexicon,” said Giladi.\n\nHer sense of displacement is echoed by many of the 60,000 residents of 32 communities in northern Israel, who have been homeless since being evacuated beginning on October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah and allied groups began firing into Israel in solidarity with Hamas and the war that the allied terror group had sparked in Gaza with its invasion of the south a day earlier.\n\nThe fighting in the north saw daily indiscriminate Hezbollah attacks on communities near the border, and occasionally further south, drawing Israeli reprisals. The simmering conflict broke open in late September as Israel decapitated the terror group’s leadership and launched a limited ground invasion into southern Lebanon amid intensified fire on the north.  It came to an end with a temporary truce on November 27, 2024, followed in February by a permanent, albeit shaky, ceasefire agreement.\n\nOver 13 months, the attacks claimed the lives of 46 civilians inside Israel and 83 Israeli soldiers, with hundreds more wounded. Homes, businesses, farms and infrastructure in dozens of northern towns suffered extensive damage, and a once-thriving tourist industry was left decimated.\n\nAbout 61% of the evacuees have returned to their communities since fighting ended, according to the Alma Research and Education Center, an independent nonprofit specializing in security challenges on Israel’s northern border.\n\nSome are staying away until the end of the school year, or have no homes to return to yet. In Shtula and nearby Kibbutz Sasa, many expressed a deep sense of uncertainty about whether the ceasefire with Hezbollah will hold.\n\nIn the six months since the ceasefire, Israel has carried out sporadic attacks on what it says are Hezbollah members in southern Lebanon, and has left troops at four key locations across the border in a bid to ensure the terror group does not rebuild a military foothold along the frontier. So far, Hezbollah, which is thought to have been significantly weakened by the war, has resisted responding.\n\n“From 2022 until the summer of 2023, Hezbollah was 100 percent ready to invade northern Israel,” Lt. Col. (Ret.) Sarit Zehavi, the CEO and founder of the Alma Center, spoke at a conference in Kibbutz Lochamei HaGhettaot on May 21. “Right now is what I’d call the cease between fires. We can’t keep fooling ourselves after October 7.”\n\nOn October 7, 2023, thousands of Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel, killed 1,200 people, and kidnapped 251 people into the Gaza Strip. The attack stands as a chilling, ominous reminder to northern residents of what could have befallen them if Hezbollah had implemented what Israel says were its own plans for a massive cross-border assault.\n\nThe western Galilee moshav of Shtula was founded in 1969 by a small group of families from Kurdistan and Iraq. The family of Giladi, who was 16 at the time, was among them.\n\nResidents mostly supported themselves with small family farms. Giladi dreamed of opening a hospitality business, but worried about the community’s location on the northern border. “Who will come to Shtula to eat?” she recalled asking herself at the time.\n\nBefore the war, approximately 300 people called the moshav home. The community prided itself on its mix of religious, traditional, and “young folks with dogs and tattoos,” according to another Shtula resident,Hadas Lahav.\n\nAfter the war ended, the roads damaged by tank treads were repaired. But there are still destroyed cars and mangled bus shelters that haven’t yet been removed. Many houses are pockmarked with shrapnel.\n\nGiladi, a member of the temporary planning board of the moshav, said that 20% of residents had already moved back. She believes more will return in July, after the end of the school year.\n\nOnly some 2% said they do not plan to return. Still, the community hopes to expand its footprint, with 15 families expressing interest in moving there.\n\nThe community is also hoping that visitors will return.\n\nOhad Hatan, who owns the On the Border Cafe in the moshav, said he is finishing renovations and plans to re-open shortly, hoping that people will visit.\n\nThe cafe is located in a grove of trees next to what is known as the “Talking Walls” border, a concrete barrier erected to protect the town that was festooned in 2018 with murals by a number of international artists.\n\nDuring the first part of Giladi’s evacuation, she stayed at her children’s houses and then at a hotel in Tel Aviv, where she ran a pop-up Kurdish food restaurant and did well.\n\n“But a house is not only four walls, it’s also my history, my memories, my essence,” she said. As the war raged, she had “moments of crisis, but I know how to find happiness. My friends who had nothing to do except sit in the hotel lobby were broken.”\n\nSpeaking at the Alma Center conference, Dmitry Apartsev, Senior Director of Government Relations Department, Northern Reconstruction Headquarters, said that the government has allocated NIS 8 billion ($226,000,000) over four years to address the needs of the frontline communities in the north. The money is an opportunity to provide “broad and comprehensive solutions, not just localized or emergency responses.”\n\nGiladi said she is optimistic but also pragmatic.\n\nWalking her visitor out of her gate, she reached for a grape leaf hanging off a vine and nimbly folded it into an envelope, explaining how she used to stuff them to make kubbeh for guests visiting her home, something she won’t be able to do, at least for a while.\n\n“This is a reality I can’t change,” she said.\n\nSome 15 kilometers (nine miles) to the east, members of Kibbutz Sasa were chatting over food at long tables in the community’s communal dining room.\n\nDuring the war, almost all the 450 members of the kibbutz were evacuated, but 90% of them have since returned.\n\nVarda Yatom, 79, who has lived on the kibbutz since 1964, said that during the evacuation, “12 elderly kibbutz members died of broken hearts.”\n\n“It was very hard for them to be away from the kibbutz,” Yatom said.\n\nSurrounded by grapevines, apple orchards, and trees, Sasa sits about 3 kilometers (two miles) from the Lebanese border, a short distance that was seemingly enough to save it from the kind of extensive damage seen on Shtula.\n\nThe worst damage was suffered by a school auditorium that took a direct hit, with much of the rest of the town escaping unscathed.\n\nYatom said she wanted to believe that Hezbollah leaders decided not to destroy the kibbutz the way “Nazis preserved Paris, so they’d have somewhere to go for a holiday.”\n\nThe internationally acclaimed artist moved to Kibbutz Nachsholim during her evacuation, but was unable to find a place to make her art.\n\nDuring the war, she sometimes returned under fire to her studio in the kibbutz.\n\n“I didn’t feel fear,” Yatom said as she stood in her kibbutz gallery, where her sculptures are displayed. “I’d rather die with clay in my hand than not work on my art. A day without doing art is wasted.”\n\nAnother kibbutz member, Edna Angelica Calo Livne, 69, stayed on the kibbutz during the war to be with her husband, who is part of the kibbutz’s emergency response team.\n\nCalo Livne, who moved from Italy to the kibbutz in 1975, is the founder of Beresheet LaShalom, a community theater group for Jews, Muslims, Druze, and Christians meant to foster dialogue through performing arts.\n\nDuring the fighting, she traveled to Italy on several occasions to speak about her experiences. People there were surprised to hear that even during war, she still believed in peace, she said.\n\nMany in the north remain circumspect that the calm will last. Next week will mark 43 years since Israel invaded Lebanon in an operation advertised as bringing peace to the Galilee, a promise belied by decades of skirmishes and now two major wars.\n\n“Hezbollah has not given up its dream of destroying Israel,” Tal Beeri, the director of Alma’s Research Department, said at the May 21 conference. “The ideology of Hezbollah hasn’t changed.”\n\nBut Calo Livne remains undeterred.\n\n“If we don’t believe in peace, we have no future,” she said. “Each day, we can discover how many resources, energy, and answers we have. Life always teaches us something new and unpredictable.”\n\n"

    "url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-claims-hamas-losing-control-over-gaza-civilians-as-ghf-ramps-up-aid-operations/",
    "content": "A senior Israeli defense official briefing reporters on Friday asserted that Hamas is losing control of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, as the new Israeli-backed aid initiative ramps up its operations aimed at preventing the terror group from diverting aid.\n\nBut the assertion that Hamas’s grip in the Strip is slipping has been made repeatedly by Israeli officials since thebeginningof the war.\n\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation announced Friday that it had distributed over two million meals at three distribution sites in southern and central Gaza over the past five days. But its classification of meals is based on boxes of dry food products that still require cooking equipment or community kitchens, which are very limited throughout the Strip after nearly 20 months of devastating conflict.\n\nThe two million meals came from 23,040 boxes of food GHF said it had distributed this week. But this amounts to around just 40 trucks worth of aid when international organizations have asserted that aid from at least 300 trucks needs to be distributed each day in order to fend off famine in Gaza after Israel blocked aid from entering the Strip for 78 days.\n\nStill, the Israeli defense official was bullish about the tide turning against Hamas while briefing reporters Friday on condition of anonymity.\n\n“The barrier of fear from Hamas has been broken. Hamas repeatedly tried to break the population and resist the distribution plan to preserve its ability to control food and, consequently, the residents of the Gaza Strip,” the defense official said.\n\n“The residents of the Strip voted with their feet against Hamas and flocked en masse to the distribution centers, thereby breaking an initial barrier of public fear from Hamas, which undermines its governing component needed to preserve its ruling capabilities,” the official said.\n\nAccording to the official, the new aid distribution system is intended first to cut Hamas off from the aid — as it is no longer involved in the distribution process — and secondly to cut the population off from Hamas, potentially collapsing the terror group’s civil rule in the Strip, which is one of Israel’s war goals.\n\nThe official slammed “many elements within Hamas and UN organizations that defame and hope for the failure of the aid distribution plan via the distribution centers.”\n\n“Elements in Gaza and within Hamas are trying to create chaos and disorder to sabotage our efforts and drive a psychological campaign and generate a false narrative,” the official added.\n\nOf the 238 trucks of aid that set out from Kerem Shalom to be distributed in Gaza in recent days, 135 were looted, according to military estimates. The looting was largely carried out by civilians, and in some cases, armed gangs who had no affiliation with Hamas, the military official said, underlining the terror group’s weakened control.\n\nAccording to the official, to enable the UN to collect and distribute the aid entering Gaza, the Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) held meetings with UN officials, and several adjustments were made to the transportation routes — some of which had gone through combat zones — and other logistical solutions were provided.\n\nStill, COGAT has accused the UN of failing to collect over 550 truckloads of aid waiting on the Gaza side of Kerem Shalom Crossing.\n\nUN officials and aid groups say they have faced significant challenges distributing the aid because of insecurity, the risk of looting and Israel’sfailureto provide safe routes for them to pick up the aid at the border and then ferry it to warehouses ahead of distribution.\n\nA spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA held his own briefing with reporters on Friday in Geneva during which he described Gaza as “the hungriest place on Earth.”\n\n“It’s the only defined area — a country or defined territory within a country — where you have the entire population at risk of famine. 100 percent of the population at risk of famine,” said Jens Laerke, rejecting claims to the contrary by Israeli authorities.\n\nLaerke said 900 trucks of humanitarian aid had been authorized by Israel to enter the Strip since the blockade was partially lifted last week.\n\nBut so far only 600 trucks have been offloaded on the Gaza side of the border, and a smaller number of truckloads have then been picked up, due to multiple security considerations.\n\nLaerke said the mission to deliver aid was “in an operational strait-jacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid operations not only in the world today, but in recent history.”\n\nOnce truckloads enter Gaza, they are often “swarmed by desperate people,” Laerke said.\n\n“I don’t blame them, for one second, for taking the aid that essentially is already theirs — but it’s not distributed in the way we want.”\n\nTaking aim at GHF, Laerke said that by having people collect aid rather than delivering it to them where they are, they become a target for looters once they leave the site.\n\n“It is so desperate and tragic and frustrating and wildly unhumanitarian,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, hospital officials and paramedics said Friday that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza killed at least 14 more people and wounded others.\n\nOfficials at Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza said the bodies of 12 people, including three women, were brought in Friday from the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the bodies of two people as well as nine others who were wounded were taken to Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City. It said one of the wounded is a doctor who works at the same hospital.\n\nThe IDF said it struck dozens of targets in the Gaza Strip, which included terror operatives, buildings used by terror groups, observation and sniper posts, tunnels and other terror infrastructure.\n\nDuring recent operations of the 98th Division in the Khan Younis area of the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF said it demolished a kilometer-long Hamas tunnel.\n\nThe tunnel was discovered by the Commando Brigade and the elite Yahalom combat engineering unit, amid a new offensive against Hamas.\n\nAccording to the IDF, while scanning the tunnel, troops located several Hamas operatives holed up inside and eliminated them.\n\nHamas separately published an unusual video purporting to show its operatives detonating an explosive device against what it says are “undercover” Israeli soldiers in southern Gaza’s Rafah.\n\nThe Friday video shows a group of armed men in civilian clothing being hit by a bomb.\n\nSome reports from Gaza indicated that the armed group is affiliated with Yasser Abu Shabab, a leader of a large clan in the Rafah area.\n\nAbu Shabab claims his forces have been protecting aid convoys, while Hamas has accused him of looting the aid trucks and maintaining connections with Israel.\n\nIsraeli officials declined to comment on Abu Shabab’s or other militias’ activities in Gaza.\n\nAlso on Friday, Haaretz reported that the primary activity of Israeli forces in Gaza has become the systemic destruction of infrastructure. The IDF says it is being done in order to protect soldiers, adding that Hamas is using much of the infrastructure for military purposes, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastalkedabout destroying homes in Gaza so that civilians have nowhere to return, making it easier to advance US President Donald Trump’s mass emigration plan. Netanyahu last week made implementing Trump’s plan a condition for ending the war.\n\nAccording to Hamas’s health ministry, more than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Strip since the terror group stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Hamas death tolls cannot be independently verified and do not distinguish between civilians and fighters. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel during the Hamas onslaught.\n\n"

    "content": "Iran on Friday summoned Austria’s charge d’affaires after it branded as “fake” an Austrian intelligence report that said Tehran is seeking to acquire atomic weapons.\n\nThe spat comes even as Tehran pursues delicate negotiations with the United States on its nuclear program.\n\nIn its annual report on global threats, Austria’s domestic intelligence service (DSN) said Monday that Iran’s “nuclear weapons development program is well advanced.”\n\nThe United States, Israel and other Western countries have repeatedly accused Iran of seeking to acquire a nuclear weapon. Tehran has repeatedly threatened to destroy Israel.\n\nIran has categorically denied the claims, instead arguing that it is pursuing a nuclear program for civilian purposes alone.\n\nAccording to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), however, Iran is the only country in the world that enriches uranium up to 60 percent, a number that has no civilian uses.\n\nThat rate is still just below the 90% threshold required for a nuclear weapon, but far above the 3.67% limit set under a 2015 agreement with world powers.\n\n“All efforts to prevent Iran’s armament through sanctions and agreements have so far proved ineffective,” the Austrian report said.\n\nOn Friday, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned “the fake information” disseminated in the report and demanded an explanation from Austria’s government.\n\nIt later summoned Austria’s charge d’affaires in Tehran Michaela Pacher to “convey Iran’s strong protest,” the official IRNA news agency reported.\n\nIt said that during the meeting, the ministry “emphasized the complete contradiction of the Austrian report with numerous IAEA reports.”\n\nThe IAEA, whose headquarters are in the Austrian capital, will in the coming days publish its own review of Iran’s nuclear activities.\n\nIran and the United States are engaged in an Omani-mediated effort to reach a deal on Tehran’s nuclear program, after Donald Trump during his first presidency pulled out of the 2015 agreement.\n\nNo date has yet been set for the next Iran-US meeting since last week’s discussions in Rome.\n\nOn Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he was “not sure” that a deal with the United States was imminent.\n\nHis statement came after Trump said on Wednesday that the two sides were “very close to a solution.”\n\nTimes of Israel Staff contributed to this report\n\n"

    "url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/beitar-jerusalem-fans-attack-arab-bus-drivers-after-teams-loss-no-arrests-so-far/",
    "content": "Dozens of fans of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team attacked two Arab bus drivers in Jerusalem on Thursday night, following a live broadcast of the team’s loss in the State Cup finals.\n\nIn videos shared on social media, fans can be seen punching a driver and throwing objects in his direction. Footage also shows the driver throwing the bus’s small trash can at the assailants in self-defense. Another clip shows another driver pushing fans against the door of a bus, as they hit him.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, no one has been arrested in connection with the incident, and no suspects have been announced by police.\n\nOne of the bus drivers, Ahmad Karhin, told the Haaretz newspaper that he was driving the 77 line, which ends at Malha Mall, near the team’s home, Teddy Stadium, where the game was being broadcast.\n\n“Many tens of young Beitar Jerusalem fans arrived, I recognized them from the clothes and scarves,” he recalled.\n\n“They identified that I was Arab after they spoke with me, and they started, out of nowhere, to yell at me ‘Death to Arabs,’ to curse and to attack me. The whole time, more and more of them were joining,” he said.\n\nKarhin told Haaretz that another Arab bus driver, Mohammad Saj, arrived at the scene and helped him, but that the second driver was also attacked.\n\n“No one was helping me apart from that driver,” Karhin recalled.\n\n“The police arrived 20 minutes later, maybe half an hour, and they rescued me from there and brought me to Magen David Adom, who transferred me to a hospital. I was scared for my life, I was afraid I wouldn’t get out of there alive,” he said.\n\nHe added: “This isn’t the first time drivers have been attacked, but it was the most brutal incident.”\n\nSaj, a resident of East Jerusalem, told the Ynet news site: “I saw Karhin attacked by dozens of Beitar Jerusalem fans. I stopped and got off [my bus] and helped him, and I was also attacked.\n\n“They cursed at me, ‘Arabs are sons of whores, dogs, we’ll burn you, get out of here,’ and other racist statements,” he recalled.\n\nIsrael Police said in a statement: “We look with severity upon acts of barbarism and violence in the public square, in particular when they are committed against public servants and bus drivers.”\n\n“Immediately upon receiving notice, officers arrived at the scene, scanned for suspects and opened an investigation. We will continue to operate with determination and using any means at our disposal to locate the suspects and circumstances of the incident,” the statement concluded.\n\nThe two drivers who were attacked, both East Jerusalem residents, work for the Superbus company.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Superbus said the incidents “join many other violent incidents that have occurred on a daily basis against bus drivers in Jerusalem.\n\n“In videos from the violent incidents last night, the criminals are clearly visible and we expect and call on all law enforcement bodies, and the management of Beitar Jerusalem, to bring the law-breakers to justice immediately,” the company said.\n\nThe Beitar team and their fans, particularly the hardcore group of ultras known as “La Familia,” have a long reputation of racism, routinely chanting “death to Arabs” at games and refusing to integrate Arab or Muslim players into the team.\n\nThe Koach LaOvdim labor union said it was “weighing taking steps as an organization,” declaring in a statement that it “will not agree to public transit workers being punching bags for passengers.”\n\nIti Cohen, who heads the transit employees’ branch of Koach LaOvdim, warned, “Every day brings us closer to the murder of a driver or fare inspector.”\n\n“The 77 is prone to disaster at the end of every Beitar game. We’ve warned the police and the administration about this more than once, and the threat only gets worse,” Cohen said, and demanded that the Transportation Ministry provide more security for transit employees.\n\nJerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion condemned the attack on the bus drivers — the first time he has done so for an incident of this type, according to the Kan public broadcaster.\n\n“The violence against the bus drivers crosses a red line,” Lion said in a statement. “We cannot accept a reality in which hard-working, dedicated workers fear for their lives while doing their job.\n\n“Harming someone based on their origin or their sex is a severe, intolerable thing and goes against our Jewish values,” he added.\n\nThe mayor called on “the police and Transportation Ministry to work with determination to eradicate this phenomenon and watch over the security of drivers and passengers alike.”\n\nAs of Friday morning, Transportation Minister Miri Regev was yet to comment on the incident, drawing her own condemnation from MK Na’ama Lazimi, of the left-wing Democrats party.\n\n“More than 12 hours have passed since a group of rioters violently and harshly attacked a bus driver after the Trophy final, and the transportation minister, who is apparently busy searching for her next flight — still has not said a word about the attack on the driver, and Ben Gvir’s police haven’t arrested anyone,” she wrote on X, referring to the far-right national security minister.\n\n"
